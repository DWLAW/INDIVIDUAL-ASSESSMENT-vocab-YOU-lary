An application that allows users to Create, Read, Update, and Delete (CRUD) vocabulary cards, authenticate with Google, and filter.

 I primarily intended the app for making cards for Kanji but feel free to use it for vocabulary of any language just ignore the hiragana field and substitute pronunciation.

 # Features

 - Create Vocabulary Flashcards with the word on the front and the definition and pronunciation on the back.
 - Read the vocab that YOU the user have submitted.
 - Update and edit any preexisting flashcards you have created.
 - Delete any flashcards you no longer wish to see.
 - Filter by what part of speech the word is( noun, verb, adverb, adjective).
